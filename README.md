PS2_Mouse_Verilog
=================

PS2 Controller in Verilog as part of my Digital System Laboratory Class. 
Most of the code was provided... in a PDF :/ It also didn't have a close to uniform coding style. I refactored it out of necessity.
Debugging was a nightmare. (That moment when you're frantically hunting an erratic bug when it's not your code that's wrong, it's the provided code that's missing a stop bit...)
The UCF file is for the 100 series of the Diligent Basys2 FPGA.
