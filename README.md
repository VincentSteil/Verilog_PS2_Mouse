PS2_Mouse_Verilog
=================

PS2 Controller in Verilog as part of my Digital System Laboratory Class. Most of the code was provided, debugging was a nightmare (that moment when you're frantically hunting an erratic bug when it's not your code that's wrong, it's the provided code that's missing a stop bit...)
